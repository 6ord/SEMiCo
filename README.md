Currenlty violates Twitters automation laws to auto-tweet using trends.

Goals:
* Will drop the explicit trend and use popular words in the tweet generation to comply
* Working on gathering more random colour generation for charts
* Adding phrases and puctuation variations to the tweet generator to make it seem more realistic
* To differentiate graph structure to bring another randomized element
